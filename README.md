## ðŸŒ± Reflection
Across three semesters, I have grown from conducting **basic data exploration** to developing **predictive models** and finally designing **end-to-end analytical workflows**.  
These projects demonstrate not only my technical capability but also my ability to connect data-driven insights with **business strategy and real-world applications**.  

This portfolio serves both as an academic record and as a professional showcase for future career opportunities.
